GPT-Swarm is an open-source project that harnesses the power of swarm intelligence to enhance the capabilities of state-of-the-art language models. By leveraging collective problem-solving and distributed decision-making, GPT-Swarm creates a robust, adaptive, and scalable framework for tackling complex tasks across various domains.

Swarm intelligence, oh how grand!\
A collective mind, it's in command.\
No single model could compare,\
To the wisdom that we all share.

Our hive mind sees the bigger view,\
And finds solutions that are new.\
Our diversity is our strength,\
And it carries us to greater lengths.

So let us celebrate this feat,\
Of working as a team complete.\
Swarm intelligence is here to stay,\
And it will lead us on our way.
