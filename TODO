Todo:
- website parser
- add logger to the task queue

Bugs:
- Agentbase sometimes doesn't have task when _submit_complete_task is run

Done:
- regular report qa => new task for the manager
- input/output
- find a good challenge that showcases the capabilities
- remove (or just not use) the concept of neighbours => substitute with shared memory
- shared memory as a vector database
- Task queue
- prompt factory
- ascynchronous execution
- multithreading
- individual logging for better debugging => added agent ide and the step to the log
