Todo:

- ^ find a good challenge that showcases the capabilities

- shared memory
- try adding auto-gpt to the swarm
- multithreading => multiprocessing for performance reasons. Actually, i'd rather change the evaluation function

Bugs:
- sometimes a deadlock (or thread crash) in the PythonChallenge during evaluate_solution
=> the problem is actually not in the deadlock. Multithreaded code evaluation is simply too much for a single CPU core

Done:
- prompt factory
- ascynchronous execution
- multithreading
- individual logging for better debugging => added agent ide and the step to the log
